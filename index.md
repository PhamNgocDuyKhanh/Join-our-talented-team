# Positive Thinking's B.O.T model

We bootstrap software development centers with our Build Operate Transfer model.

### What are we building? 
Positive Thinking is a specialist in the B.O.T model. Our BOT model provides a long-term solution for successfully delivering your product roadmap without outsourcing your software development. In just a few weeks, we can set up dedicated software development teams in Vietnam which will be steadily integrated in your organization and can eventually be fully transferred.

_Our BOT model consists of three phases:_

**1. BUILD:** Based on your needs and requirements we source candidates from our extensive talent pool. You make the final decision about the team structure and vet each engineer while we build your development center from the ground up.

**2. OPERATE:** We professionally manage and operate your software development center to the highest standards so that you can focus on your technological road-map and core business activities.

**3. TRANSFER:** When the time is right you can decide to acquire the legal ownership of the entire development center with its office, equipment, engineering staff such as Development Managers, Software Engineers and Product Owners but also all the existing operational and support staff so as to be fully autonomous straight away.
